## Behavior Description

For this assignment, we expanded our RAT MCU from RAT 5 by filling in most the signals in the control unit, increasing its functionality and being able to handle more assembly language instructions. In addition, we implemented the RAT_WRAPPER given to us in order to allow the MCU to interface with our Basys 3 board. Doing this allows our components to run programs from the prog_rom. From here, we were able to run the 6 tests from PolyLearn. We first assembled the ASM files and then routed them in our MCUâ€™s prog_rom. By using the RAT_WRAPPER, we could see the results of the tests through the LEDs on the Basys 3 board.
