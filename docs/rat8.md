## Behavior Description

For this assignment, we expanded our RAT_MCU and RAT_Wrapper from RAT 7. For the RAT_MCU, we added SHAD_Z and SHAD_C modules will are in use when interrupts are triggered. In addition, we added muxes to the existing c and z-flag modules so that both modules can receive either flag inputs from the ALU or the corresponding shadow flag modules. As for the RAT_Wrapper, we added the one shot debouncer module given to us, and implemented the seven segment display module by Mealy. Similar to what we did in RAT 6 and 7, we ran a test case from PolyLearn. We first assembled the ASM files and then routed them in our MCUâ€™s prog_rom. From there, we could see the proper result on the Basys 3 board. The explanation on how the Basys3 should properly output was describe in the beginning of the phase three test case. The verification section will explain in more detail our use of the Basys3 board shows that our entire RAT CPU is working properly.
