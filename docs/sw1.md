# Software Assignment 1

## Behavior Description

Our first program is supposed to take in three different inputs from a specified port, add them together, and send the output to another specified port. The data is 8-bit unsigned integers, the input port is 0x30, and the output port is 0x40.

The second program we worked on essentially returns the negative of the input in 2â€™s complement form. To accomplish this, we took input through port 0x30 as an 8-bit signed value. We inverted this input using an EXOR operation, added 1, and then outputted the value to port 0x40.
